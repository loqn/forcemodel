# Force model in graphs

This is a small C++ program, using SFML2.6 to render force model inside a valued graph.

*** 

Just do `make` to compile the program. It may take some time (it still requires some optimization).

In this implementation and with the given parameters (in [ForceModel](./src/ForceModel.cpp) file), you can change radically the rendered output.
